The HAMS monitoring client (MC HAMer):
Requirements: python3, pip3, names, requests, psutil
Installation:
- copy the mc_hamer.zip file to the node you want to integrate to the EMS.
	[scp mc_hamer.zip <username>@<ip_of_node>:<location>]
- unzip the package
	[unzip mc_hamer.zip]

- Two options how to install:
	- fully automated with the install.sh script
		[bash install.sh -u <ip_of_backend>:<port> -t <secret_pin>][optional: -i <send_intervall> -n <name>]
		-u and -t are required, for the send_interval and name default values will be used if not specified.
	- manually:
		- install python3 requirements:
			[pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt]
		- to run as a service, copy this into "/home/<user_name>/.config/systemd/user/mc_hamer.service":
			"""
			[Unit]
			Description=Monitoring Client for HAM EMS

			[Service]
			ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 <path_to_mc>/mc_hamer.py
			Restart=always

			[Install]
			WantedBy=default.target
			"""
		- enable and start service:
			systemctl --user enable mc_hamer.service
			systemctl --user start mc_hamer.service

- run in debug mode:
	if something went wrong with the automated installation, you can check with the debug mode
	[python3 mc_hamer.py -u <ip_of_backend>:<port> -t <secret_pin> -d True]

- Node identity:
	Each node has to register to the Backend and will receive a uniqe uuid.
	This ID is stored with the node name in /home/user_name/.hamer-token
	If you want a node to register new again, you have to remove the identity file

- help:
	Both, the install.sh and the mc_hamer.py are provided with a help menu. Just use the "-h" parameter.

- Node deletion:
    If a node is deleted by the admin on the frontend, the MC provides a de-register function, which will disable and stop the servive
    and remove the '.hamer-token' file in the users home directory.
