\end{frame}

\subsection{Mistakes}
\begin{frame}{Mistakes}
 \itemize
 \item Testing and bugfixing began before actual finalization of the product
 \item Major code changes in the middle of the sprint led to conflicts
 \item Very late deployment: Problems occured while running on VM that were not present on local build
 
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Product}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Major changes}
\itemize
\item Dashboards and Management Pages are functional
\item Overworked Alert Rules (Average, Standard Deviation, Kurtosis)
\item No more temporary links for password distribution/reset (Vue limitation)
\item Currently deployed version is not version in the final submission (fixes were done)
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Known issues}
\itemize
\item No KPI records older than 60 minutes are displayed on dashboard
\item FE slows down heavily over time (Probably gumming up browser cache)
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Live Demo}
\itemize
\item Dashboard
\item User creation and changes
\item User rights
\end{frame}

\section{Documentation}

\subsection{Security Report}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Security Report}
\itemize
\item Port scan with nmap: Weak cipher key length
\item Automated scans with nikto and owasp-zap: Slight clickjacking vulnerability, Email address could be detected in SSL info
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Security Report}
\itemize
\item Burp Proxy: Capture requests of user interactions, check jwt-accesstoken
\item Wireshark: Encryption could be verified
\item SQL injection: No vulnerability found (SQL queries are auto-generated by Spring)
\item Brute Force Login: Very weak password policy
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Unit Tests}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Unit Tests}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Halfway through the sprint, all Unit Tests were written and "green". \\
	\item However, major code changes broke most Unit Tests. \\
    \item Re-writing Unit Tests was not possible due to limited time.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Sprint retrospective and EP Wrap-up}
\subsection{Sprint 05: Negative}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sprint 05: Negative}
\begin{itemize}
\item workload left from Sprint 04 caused a major delay
\item Testing was started too soon (in our specific case)
\item Deployment began too late
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Sprint 05: Positive}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Sprint 05: Positive}
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Great implementation catch-up during the first half of the sprint
	\item No panic despite pressing time constraints
	\item After major roadblocks, we still delivered a presentable product!
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{EP Wrap-Up}
\begin{frame}\small
\begin{itemize}
	\frametitle{EP Wrap-Up}
	\item Across the entire project, we were prone to underestimating our tasks
	\item Communication was generally lacking, mostly due to different schedules)
	\item But in the end: Teamwork makes the dream work!
	\item Final standings: 12,000 Lines of Code (6,000 Backend, 4,000 Frontend, 2,000 Monitoring Client) across 1,000 commits
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
